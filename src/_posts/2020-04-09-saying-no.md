> Saying yes to one feature means saying no to all of the other features your team could be building at that time.

A great and simple write up by my friend, [Tadhg](https://twitter.com/@tadhgol). It's so easy to keep your head in the clouds about all the things your website or app can do.

Without consistent focus, apps face a certain death by a thousand paper cuts disguised as &#8216;feature requests&#8217;.

I'm digging Tadhg's newsletter. You can read the whole piece here (and subscribe!): [https://productpiece.substack.com/p/saying-no](https://productpiece.substack.com/p/saying-no?utm_source=marcano.io)
