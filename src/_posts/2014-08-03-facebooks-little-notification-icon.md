If you are still a Facebook user, you’re probably aware of the little tiny icon of Earth that represents your notifications. You know, it’s the first icon you click after you open Facebook…

Yeah, well I noticed a recent change in that icon on my phone and in my web browser. After a little digging I had found this “Slate” article. It turns out, this icon is now different for Facebook’s users depending on where they live in the world. As I am currently in Europe, my notification’s icon now illustrates the other side of the Atlantic.

When companies spend time on little details just to make a little better experience for their users, I tend to genuinely enjoy it. I just thought I’d share the little things that make my day.
