If you are still a Facebook user, you’re probably aware of the little tiny icon of Earth that represents your notifications. You know, it’s the first icon you click after you open Facebook…

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="92" src="https://i1.wp.com/beta.marcano.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Facebook_US_Notification.png?resize=500%2C92&#038;ssl=1" alt="US Notification Icon" class="wp-image-121" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/marcano.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Facebook_US_Notification.png?w=500&ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/marcano.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Facebook_US_Notification.png?resize=300%2C55&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>

Yeah, well I noticed a recent change in that icon on my phone and in my web browser. After a little digging I had found this “Slate” article. It turns out, this icon is now different for Facebook’s users depending on where they live in the world. As I am currently in Europe, my notification’s icon now illustrates the other side of the Atlantic.

When companies spend time on little details just to make a little better experience for their users, I tend to genuinely enjoy it. I just thought I’d share the little things that make my day.
