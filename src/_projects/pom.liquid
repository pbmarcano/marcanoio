SARS-CoV-2 stopped the world. The team at [POM](https://getthepom.com/) got together and found a way to help.

Lukas Lampe, Co-founder &amp; CTO at POM, reached out to me with an idea to help schools and businesses who couldn't work from home prevent COVID outbreaks. 

POM built bluetooth tags that anonymously tracks and logs other POM tags around them, and upload that raw tag data to our massive data lake.

To better understand the challenge, we absorbed every fact and detail the CDC, John's Hopkins, and any every other expert we could find to understand the problem deeper than any.

My job would be to build the web-based backend that would register the tags to the people in an organization, and de-anonymize the exposure data to generate detailed contact tracing reports in minutes.

Without POM, organizations have to rely on data gathered by a limited number of contact tracers, performing interviews with varying detail, to inform isolate exposed people in place. If they aren't able to trace accurately or quickly enough, outbreaks harm employees, students, and their families. Expanding the spread and risking more lives.

With POM, a company just puts in details about an employee who just tested positive and they get a list of high risk individuals to quarantine within minutes.

In just a couple months the platform was live and immediately began [helping schools](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/public-and-private-schools-show-a-pandemic-learning-divide-99949637830) and workplaces stop the spread of COVID. After countless rapid iterations, we've added anonymous metrics to measure the affectiveness social distancing and other preventative measures.

[POM Tracer](https://pomtracer.com) is available to companies of all sizes and the team is ready to work with you to keep your school or company safe.
