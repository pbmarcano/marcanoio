I make software for small businesses that are interested in turning a profit.

I look at projects with a business-school lens and work within a process to manage deadlines and budgets.

Thereâ€™s likely a handful of ways I could help you. Drop your name and email below to schedule a free 30 minute consultation.

You can find me around the web at various places.
